        that precious package that is your business.<br><br>
        Now, we are sure you are asking yourself: <br><br>
            1. Why let us do the work for you when there are plenty of
            other guys out there?<br>
            2. Why shouldn't you just let your sister's friend's nephew's son do it for you for free?<br><br>
        Great questions with simple answers. </p><br><br>

        <p>1. Not everyone that does this is as concerned about
               quality or knows how to make your site stand out and not
               look like all the rest.<br>
            2. We don't use templates unless you absolutely require it.
               We always try to do custom themes/layouts.<br>
            3.Your sister's friend's nephew's son has no reson to stay
               within your deadline and most likely doesn't know how your
               site needs to be presented for your industry. - time is money.<br>
            <br>
            These are just some of the reasons that make us stand out from the rest.
            <br><br>So feel free to look around, check out sor gallery/portfolio
            and then just request a quote and we can begin showing off
             your business to the world! </p><br><br>
